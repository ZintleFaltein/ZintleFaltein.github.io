To make worship music more accessible, I volunteer as a song translator for [Hillsong church](https://hillsong.com/music/). My role includes translating songs from English to isiXhosa, re-recording them, and sharing the final versions with our diverse congregation. Itâ€™s a meaningful way to bridge language and culture through music.
